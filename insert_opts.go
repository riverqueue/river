	// 4 being the lowest. When fetching available jobs to work, the highest

	// then they can handle, lower priority jobs may not be fetched.

	// ScheduledAt is a time in future at which to schedule the job (i.e. in
	// cases where it shouldn't be run immediately). The job is guaranteed not
	// to run before this time, but may run slightly after depending on the
	// number of other scheduled jobs and how busy the queue is.

	// JobArgsWithInsertOpts, however, it will work in both cases.

// UniqueOpts contains parameters for uniqueness for a job.

// When the options struct is uninitialized (its zero value) no uniqueness at is
// enforced. As each property is initialized, it's added as a dimension on the
// uniqueness matrix, and with any property on, the job's kind always counts
// toward uniqueness.
//
// So for example, if only ByQueue is on, then for the given job kind, only a
// single instance is allowed in any given queue, regardless of other properties
// on the job. If both ByArgs and ByQueue are on, then for the given job kind, a
// single instance is allowed for each combination of args and queues. If either
// args or queue is changed on a new job, it's allowed to be inserted as a new
// job.

	// ByPeriod defines uniqueness within a given period. On an insert time is
	// rounded down to the nearest multiple of the given period, and a job is
	// only inserted if there isn't an existing job that will run between then
	// and the next multiple of the period.
	//
	// Default is no unique period, meaning that as long as any other unique
	// property is enabled, uniqueness will be enforced across all jobs of the
	// kind in the database, regardless of when they were scheduled.
	ByPeriod time.Duration

	// ByQueue indicates that uniqueness should be enforced within each queue.
	//
	// Default is false, meaning that as long as any other unique property is
	// enabled, uniqueness will be enforced for a kind across all queues.
	ByQueue bool

	// ByState indicates that uniqueness should be enforced across any of the
	// states in the given set. For example, if the given states were
	// `(scheduled, running)` then a new job inserted as `scheduled` would be
	// not be inserted by virtue of it being not unique, but a new job marked as
	// `available` could be inserted.
	//
	// Unlike other unique options, ByState gets a default when it's not set for
	// user convenience. The default is equivalent to:
	//
	// 	ByState: []river.JobState{river.JobStateAvailable, river.JobStateCompleted, river.JobStateRunning, river.JobStateRetryable, river.JobStateScheduled}

	// With this setting, any jobs of the same kind that have been completed or
	// discarded, but not yet cleaned out by the system, won't count towards the
	// uniqueness of a new insert.
